For the brave souls who found this link, Thou Art the chosen ones.

For programming is a way of life, a journey, a quest, but without rest and unsolved puzzles.

To you, true survivors, kings of men, I say this. Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down, never gonna run around and desert you.

Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye.

Never gonna tell a lie, and hurt you.
